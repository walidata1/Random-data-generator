# Vite React App with D3.js

This is a starter template for a Vite React app with D3.js integration. It provides a basic structure and setup for developing interactive data visualizations using D3.js within a React application.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Technologies used

* Vite
* React
* D3.js
* HTML
* CSS

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.

```
git clone <https://github.com/walidata1/random-data-generator.git>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```
cd <random-data-generator>
```

3. Install the dependencies using npm.

```
npm install
```

## Development

To start the development server and run the app locally, use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser at http://localhost:5173/. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically trigger a hot-reload, reflecting the updates in the browser.

## Folder Structure

Here is the basic folder structure of the project:

```
├── public
│   ├── index.html
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.css
│   └── index.js
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── vite.config.js
```

- The `public` folder contains the static assets like `index.html` and `favicon.ico`.
- The `src` folder contains the React components, utilities, and main application files.
- The `App.js` file is the entry point of your application, where you can import and use D3.js to create data visualizations.
- The `vite.config.js` file contains the Vite configuration options.

## Usage and Examples

To generate random data and visualize it in your React application, click on "Click to refresh expenses data".
